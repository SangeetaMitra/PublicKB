### What Is "White Labeling"?

"White Labeling the Portal" simply means you can remove specific CenturyLink brand elements and information and replace them with you own:

* site branding (logo, site name)
* color scheme
* email notifications
* customer support 

White Labeling does not mean modifying or changing in any way functional content (such as server functionality). For example, a CenturyLink Cloud partner cannot rewrite the portal in another language. 

###Site Branding

Go to the "Account" > "Settings" section. Then select "Site Branding."
